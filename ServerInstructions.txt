in vscode open the terminal (or open a new one if needed by going to the top of the window > Terminal > new Terminal)
type node . into the terminal (if for some reason this doesn't work, try node index.js)
if it responds "Server is running on port (port number, currently 8080)" then it worked, if it errors or doesn't say that then it failed to start
go to your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (or whatever port the start up response gives if we ever change it) (needs to include the http:// and the :(port))
when finished, go back to the terminal and press ctrl + c to close the server (you also need to do this and type node . again for any changes made while the server is running to take effect)
